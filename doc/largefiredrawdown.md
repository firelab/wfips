Large Fire Drawdown
==============

WFIPs simulates the utilization of initial attack resources on large 
fires by making resources unavailable for new fires for a period 
of time representing the duration of the large fire. Resources at dispatch 
locations with low fire activity are preferentailly selected for large 
fires.  Users select the level that initial attack resources in the 
analysis area participate on fire escapes within the analysis area by 
resource type.
