Large Fire Drawdown
==============

WFIPs simulates the utilization of initial attack resources on large
fires by making resources unavailable for initial attack for a
period of time. Resources at dispatch locations with low fire activity 
are preferentially selected for large fires.  Users select the level  
that initial attack resources in the analysis area participate on 
fire escapes in the analysis area by resource type.
