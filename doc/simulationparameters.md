Simulation Parameters
=====================

Select simulated fire scenarios to be used in the analysis. There 
is a large range of variation between fire seasons both spatially 
and temporally. Because a fire program provides a response to future, 
unknowable fire seasons, WFIPs provides a diverse set of simulated 
fire ignition scenarios that can be used to evaluate the 
performance of the modeled fire program.
  

Selection Options
---------------------------------------------- 

The different fire scenario selection options allow for a complete 
evaluation of the modeled fire program.

- Entire Ignition Sequence
- Random Years
- Single Specific Year

"Entire Ignition Sequence" uses many fire scenarios to evaluate a 
modeled fire program's performance over a wide range of possible 
fire sceanrios. The results provide the average and variablity of 
performance along with extreme outcomes over the wide range of 
possible fire seasons. 

"Random Years" provides a smaller set of fire scenarios for the 
evaluation and hence shorter run time. Fire scenarios can be 
selected to represent years with lower, average, or higher fire 
intensity, or just a random selection. The number of fire 
years to be analyzed is specified.

"Single Specific Year" ensures that results are comparable across 
several model runs.  The number of the fire year, obtained from 
previous runs is specified.
