Simulation Parameters
=====================

Select simulated fire scenarios to be used in the analysis. Historically 
there is a large range of spatial and temporal variation in fire seasons. 
Because a fire program provides a response to future, unknowable fire 
seasons, WFIPs provides a diverse set of simulated fire ignition scenarios 
to use in evaluating the performance of the modeled fire program.
  

Selection Options
---------------------------------------------- 

The fire scenario selection options enable evaluation of the 
modeled fire program for different objectives.

- Entire Ignition Sequence
- Random Years
- Single Specific Year

"Entire Ignition Sequence" a wide range of possible fire sceanrios 
are used to evaluate the modeled fire program. The results provide 
a measure of the average and variability in performance of the 
program along with extreme outcomes. 

"Random Years" provides a smaller set of fire scenarios for the 
evaluation and hence shorter run time. Fire scenarios can be 
selected to represent years with lower, average, or higher fire 
intensity; or just a random selection. The number of fire 
years to be analyzed is specified.

"Single Specific Year" ensures that results are comparable across 
several model runs.  The number of the fire year, obtained from 
previous runs is specified.
