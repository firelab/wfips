Dispatch Locations
========

Manage dispatch locations and local resources for WFIPs analysis. 
CLICK a dispatch location to view listing of dispatch locations 
in the analysis area. CLICK drop down arrows at left of dispatch
location name to view the resources based at the dispatch location. 
Dispatch locations without an arrow have no resources. The total 
cost of all the resources in the analysis is displayed at the bottom 
of the window. Selected dispatch locations are highlighted on the 
map (unless they are covered by another dispatch location).

Modify Dispatch Locations and Resources
=========

- "Clone" clones the selected resource. Cloned resources are placed 
in the same dispatch location as the original, but they can be moved.

- "Add Resource" adds resource of selected type with default settings.

- "Move Resource" moves a resource to a different dispatch location.

- "Remove" removes the selected item. If a dispatch location is 
selected it is removed with all it's resources. if a resource is 
selected it is removed from the analysis.

- "Remove Empty" removes all the dispatch locations with no resources.

- "Revert" reverts the dispatch location and resource information to
it's original state.

- Select "OK" to save the changes for the analysis or "Cancel" to 
exit, leaving the dispatch locations and resources unchanged.
