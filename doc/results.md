Results
=======

Display results of one or several WFIPs analyses. 

- Single Analysis
- Analysis Series
- Compatable Analyses 

"Single Analysis" displays graphs and maps of a single analysis.

"Analysis Series" displays graphs and maps of individual results 
for each analysis in a series and/or displays composite graphs 
showing trends in the analysis series.

"Compatable Anlyses" displays graphs and maps of individual
results and/or displays graphs composed of multiple runs made using 
the same analysis area and fire scenarios.

Metrics
-------------

The analysis metrics have parameters for initial attack and large fire.

- Initial Attack
	- Initial Attack Success
	- Asset Utilization
- Large Fire
	- Acerage
	- Cost
	- Population Affected

"Initial Attack Success" is the percentage of fire ignitions that 
are contained or recieve a modified management objective.

"Asset Utilization" measures the number of times during a fire 
season when all of the resources at a dispatch location were deployed 
to fires. This is calculated as the number of days where a dispatch 
location deploys resources to fires at least as many times as there 
are resources stationed at the dispatch location.

"Acerage" is the total number of acres for all fires that are simulated 
in large fire.

"Cost" is the total cost of all fires that are simulated in large fire.

"Population Affected" is the number of people within the final perimeter 
of fires simulated in large fire.
