Prepositioning
==============

WFIPs prepositions initial attack resources within the selected analysis area 
in response to fire activity. Dispatch locations are prioritized by fire 
activity level. Users select the threshold fire activity level for 
movement by resource type.

- No Prepositioning
- Average Fire Activity
- Above Average Fire Activity
- Extreme Fire Activity

Note: Currently Engines, Handcrews, and Helitack are moved between dispatch 
locations where resources of the same resource type were stationed for the 
analysis. Additional types will be added when resource capacity by 
resource type is obtained for all dispatch locations.
